# weather-dashboard

In this challenge we had to call the weather API and then use it to show the daily forecast and the following 5 day forecast. After doing that the next challenge was to create buttons based on the search of the user that then commited it to local storage and then when the button is clicked it gets that from the local storage and displays the weather for that city rather than having to search again.
